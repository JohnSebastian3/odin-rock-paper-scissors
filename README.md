## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I built this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get the logic of the game working.

## Optimizations

Optimizations planned are refactoring code.

## Lessons Learned:

What I learned during this project was how to simulate the computer choosing randomly. It's not entirely random, but it simulates it close enough for the purpose of this app.
